                            Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Sugar and Smiles opened in 1971 and it’s just as true today.
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Sugar and Smiles offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees.
                            
                            In 1981, Andy Anderson (Sugar and Smiles chairman, president and chief executive officer) first walked into a Sugar and Smiles store.
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            From the beginning, Sugar and Smiles set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
                            
                            Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighbourhood at a time.
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            Today, with stores in more than 75 markets, Sugar and Smiles is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.
